## ```job_postings_fact``` 
- Filled values for ```avg_yearly_salary``` and ```avg_hourly_salary``` etc...
- No ```salary_rate``` column.
- Updated column names.
- Dates in ```job_posted_date``` column without the time part.
- Cleaned job_via values without the "via" prefix.

## ``` company_dim``` 
- Delete ```thumbnail``` column
- Replace Empty Values wth value

## **[Date After Cleaing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-v8bUaTvMCTNsIuVYk_Rv4K-4Sia2LU7?usp=sharing)**
