# Job Market Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing job market data using Python and SQL for data cleaning and processing, and Power BI for visualization. The dashboard serves two primary user groups:

1. **Job Seekers:** Individuals looking to explore career opportunities or make informed career decisions.
2. **Startup Owners:** Business owners aiming to identify high-potential markets and emerging trends.

## lets understand Data
-  database schema

## Data Cleaning & preparation 
## ```job_postings_fact``` 
- Filled values for ```avg_yearly_salary``` and ```avg_hourly_salary``` etc...
- No ```salary_rate``` column.
- Updated column names.
- Dates in ```job_posted_date``` column without the time part.
- Cleaned job_via values without the "via" prefix.

## ``` company_dim``` 
- Delete ```thumbnail``` column
- Replace Empty Values wth value

## **[Date After Cleaing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-v8bUaTvMCTNsIuVYk_Rv4K-4Sia2LU7?usp=sharing)**
